In this digital age, social interactions have transcended the physical sphere to the virtual one. Encouraging this phenomenon are social media platforms such as Twitter. One can easily interact with others or spread content by retweeting it. With so much influence and interaction people can have on social media, it is interesting to further explore the tendency of individuals to bond with similar others, by studying the socio-emotional division between Twitter users. This will be done by a sentiment analysis which evaluates the nature of tweets and hashtags - positive, neutral or negative. The polarity of shared content is then studied as a whole of the platform, each user as well as each users’ followers. Overall, we wish to understand if people tend to interact with others of similar polarity of sentiments.
